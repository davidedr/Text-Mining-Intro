Ever wondered how to upload a file to an FTP server in R?

## Here's how!
Let's suppose you have an acount named __*user_name*__, with password: __*user_password*__ by the ftp server with address: __*ftp.server.com*__.

To upload the local file named: __*origin_filename.ext*__ to the ftp server, in the folder: __*dest_folder*__, having name: __*destination_filename.ext*__, you simply hit:

```{r include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(RCurl)

ftpUpload("origin_filename.ext", "ftp://user_name:password@ftp.server.com/dest_folder/destination_filename.ext")

```

## This even works with DataCamp's R console!
